# Solu Framework
A full featured isomorphic framework using Expo/React Server Components (waiting for a beta or published example from [EvanBacon](https://github.com/EvanBacon), for now we will use standard [RNW](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/) and [Waku](https://github.com/dai-shi/waku))

# Purpose of this project
- Replacing or making an alternative to Odoo and Python's (2.7-3.2) synchronous, I/O blocking design with a better and leaner alternative that hopefully supports full decentralized/multi-clustered design.

- Pledging support and maintain compatibility for deploying this framework in a microservice architecture and try to prefer horizontal scaling over vertical as much as possible.

- Also pledging support for hardware interfacing and IoT on Client Devices and Server, using technologies like WebBluetooth, WebUSB and WebHID in browsers, and Cordova Modules, Node-gyp (Node.js Native Addon Tooling) Modules, React Native Modules, in native platforms.

- Build a React Native (Expo) app for major platforms, i.e., Android, iOS (Mac Catalyst too), and Web. Desktop (Windows) is still planned because current react-native-windows can only run on W10-11.

- <del>Use RPython for readability and performance.</del> Try to support any language and transpilers that Node.js runtime supports, including our own inhouse babel [plugin](https://github.com/soIu/javascripthon-plugin) using Metapensiero's [transpiler](https://github.com/soIu/javascripthon).
